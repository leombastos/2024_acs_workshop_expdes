Hey there!  

This is the prep page for the **2024 Agronomy, Crop, and Soils Graduate Student Committee Workshop - Designing and Analyzing Agricltural Studies: intro and example in R**, taught by [@leombastos](https://github.com/leombastos).    

The workshop was presented on May 10th 2024 for ~1 hour where we covered:
